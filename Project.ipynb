    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a part of project for university class \"PRiAD\" (Presentation and Analysis of Data). The main goal of this project is to analyze [South Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park) dialogues and predict which character said which dialogue. The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines. The dataset contains 70896 dialogues from 5 seasons of South Park. The dataset contains the following columns: Season, Episode, Character, Line. The dataset is in CSV format.\n",
